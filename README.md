## About This Project

This CLI tool helps event planners, office managers, or executive assistants:

- Track **Drinks**, **Foods**, **Games**, **Music**, **Location**, and **Gifts**.
- **Mark tasks as completed** when done.
- **Add new custom tasks** as needed.
- **Delete tasks** that are no longer relevant.
- **Review completed tasks** to ensure nothing is missed.

This project was created as part of my **Python Practice Portfolio** to demonstrate CLI application development and Python data structure manipulation.
