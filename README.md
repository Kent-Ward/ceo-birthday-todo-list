## 📝 About This Project

This CLI tool helps event planners, office managers, or executive assistants:

- ✅ Track **Drinks**, **Foods**, **Games**, **Music**, **Location**, and **Gifts**.
- ✅ **Mark tasks as completed** when done.
- ✅ **Add new custom tasks** as needed.
- ✅ **Delete tasks** that are no longer relevant.
- ✅ **Review completed tasks** to ensure nothing is missed.

This project was created as part of my **Python Practice Portfolio** to demonstrate CLI application development and Python data structure manipulation.
